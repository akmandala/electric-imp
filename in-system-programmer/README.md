# Electric Imp powered in-system programmer

This repository contains the Squirrel code and web interface for an Electric Imp powered in-system programmer for Atmel AVR MCUs.

For details on setting up and using the programmer see [this blog post on Depletion Region](http://depletionregion.blogspot.ch/2014/07/imp-powered-in-system-programmer.html#atmega328).

The files relating to the web interface are on a separate branch:

    $ git checkout gh-pages

That branch has its own README.md which includes details of all the third party tools used to create the web interface.

To return to the branch with the Squirrel code:

    $ git checkout master
